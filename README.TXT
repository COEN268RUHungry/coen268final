COEN 268 FINAL PROJECT MILESTONE 1

Things have done:
1.the content of most pages of the app, spend almost 2 hours for both of us to complete
2.the detail of each page which content is defined, include styles and layout. 
(1)it takes about 5 hours to learn how to use bootstrap and a plugin based on bootstrap called FlatUI. 
(2)we spend like 2-3 hours to learn about how to use GitHub.
(3)we spend about 20 hours to write the code and debugging, we write 6 main page fo the app,include css details.
The 6 pages include the Login page, Restaurant List page, Specific Restaurant information page, the Menu page, Shopping Cart page, and payment page, all these pages form a basic app.
(4)we spend 1h hour to design the database scheme, and write most of the tables, but did not launch it to server side.
(5)At the end we spend 1~2 hour to adjust the display in iphone 6 simulator, so it looks better in mobile devices.

Things needs to do:
1. More templates need to be designed, include the Admin page, Member account page.
2. Need to make the page look better.
3. As we hard-code all the data, we need to implement them dynamicly using javascript,jquery,ajax and so on.
4. Add the server side of the app and implement all the functions.
5. put the templates in Ember.js framework.
6. Find more creative function to make our app more convinient to use.

Questions:
1. Do we need to create our own database, or retrieve data from other website?
2. If some minor functions are modified in the end(a little different from the Project pitch), does it matter the grades?
